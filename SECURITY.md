## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report a vulnerability to the project's
[GitHub issues](https://github.com/Tatsh/open-in-mpv/issues), unless the vulnerability is considered
critical. In that case, email me.

### Potential issues that are _not_ considered vulnerabilities

- In the `open-in-mpv` Python script: running a rogue `mpv` executable (where it is likely a user
  has a compromised system).
- Anything in the `test-open` script as this is only for testing for use by developers.
- The lack of a complete uninstaller.
